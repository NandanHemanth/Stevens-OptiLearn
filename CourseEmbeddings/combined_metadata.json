Incorporate risk management into the decision-making process to prevent unintended negative consequences and to take advantage of opportunities. Formulate strategies to avoid negative consequences and potential impacts of human behavior on decision making. Discuss factors contributing to successful and unsuccessful decisions. Apply decision making process steps to maximize success.\n    Prerequisites: Overall course content and requirements Introduction to course Probability & Statistics Monte Carlo Simulation Decision Trees Bayes Law Decision Analysis Flow Chart Framing issues Fundamental Objective Hierarchy Means Objective Network Alternatives Idea Generation Techniques Influence Diagrams Decision Tree Application Single and multi-criteria problems Utility Theory Want & Must Have Criteria Utility Table & Curve Pairwise comparison Evaluation Scoring AHP Model Cognitive Bias Prospect Theory Human Impacts Risk Management Process Risk Mgmt Planning Risk Identification Qualitative Analysis Quantitative Risk Analysis Risk Register Threat Handling Strategies Opportunity Handling Strategies Risk Leverage Risk Monitoring Pugh Matrix Choosing a solution Engineering Trade Study Simple Sensitivity Analysis One-way sensitivity Tornado Diagram Two-way sensitivity What is Game Theory Impact on decisions Relevant factors Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell.   participation: 13% assignments: 25% projects: 25% quizzes: 10% final: 12%  attendance: Attendance at the live sessions is mandatory and will be graded. late_work: If a student needs an extension, the instructor should be contacted ahead of the due date. academic_integrity: All Stevens graduate students promise to be fully truthful and avoid dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation, and deceit of any type in relation to their academic work. accommodations: Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities.",
