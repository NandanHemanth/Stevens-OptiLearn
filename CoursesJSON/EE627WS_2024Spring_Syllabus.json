Tapping into the powerful tool of data analytics to create strategic advantage and identify new business opportunities. The studied datasets can vary from the traditional pure numerical data sets to more text related social network data. It includes the data pre-processing, feature extraction, model comparisons and selections, model induction and related forecasting or predictions. Helping students extend the concepts learned in the EE prerequisites courses to more concrete applications scenarios, like predictive modeling, time series forecasting, e-Business recommendation systems etc, and learn how to apply appropriate analytic techniques and tools to analyzing the big data sets.",
