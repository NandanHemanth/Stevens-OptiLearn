    "course_description": "This course covers the comprehensive introductions about deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry and programming exercises with related deep learning software packages. It consists of three sections. The first part reviews the applied math and machine learning basics. The second part studies the industry practices with deep networks in convolutional networks, recurrent & recursive nets, regularization for deep learning, auto-encoders etc. The last one is to train the students with real industry data for deep learning tasks at the big-data platform. By the end of the course, students will have a thorough knowledge about the state-of-the-art approaches used in deep learning.",
